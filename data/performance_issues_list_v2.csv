SlowForLoop;Runtime;Yes;;✅;✅;;;;;;;;;;;;;The standard version of the for loop is slower than the for-each loop. Therefore, Android developers should always use an enhanced version of the loop to improve the efﬁciency of the app.;;Replace standard for loops with enhanced for-each loops whenever possible. This improves performance and efficiency by avoiding unnecessary index calculations and direct array manipulations.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;SlowForLoop1.txt;SlowForLoop2.txt;;A developer is processing a collection of user notifications in an Android app. The task involves iterating through an ArrayList of notification objects to filter out expired ones before displaying them to the user. The developer needs to access each element sequentially to check timestamps and update the UI accordingly;;;;adoctor;uses org.eclipse.jdt ast parser, does not supports kotlin
DrawAllocation;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;;✅;You should avoid allocating objects during a drawing or layout operation. These are called frequently, so a smooth UI can be interrupted by garbage collection pauses caused by the object allocations. The way this is generally handled is to allocate the needed objects up front and to reuse them for each drawing operation. Some methods allocate memory on your behalf (such as Bitmap.create), and these should be handled in the same way.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/DrawAllocation.md.html;Avoid allocating new objects during drawing or layout operations (e.g onDraw methods). Instead, preallocate objects before drawing and reuse them. Methods like Bitmap.create() should also follow this approach to prevent frequent garbage collection and UI lag. Examples of such methods: android.view.View, android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDraw, android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.draw, android.view.View.invalidate, android.view.View.postInvalidate, android.view.View.onDrawForeground, android.view.View.onMeasure, android.view.ViewGroup.onLayout, android.view.View.layout, android.view.View.onSizeChanged, ;*.java, *.kt;Warning;DrawAllocation1.txt;DrawAllocation2.txt;;A developer is implementing a custom view that displays real-time data visualization.

Recycle;Memory;Yes;;;;✅;;;✅;;;;;;;;✅;Many resources, such as TypedArrays, VelocityTrackers, etc., should be recycled (with a recycle() call) after use. This lint check looks for missing recycle() calls.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/Recycle.md.html;Always call .recycle() on resources such as TypedArray, VelocityTracker, and others after use. This prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient resource management.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;Recycle1.txt;Recycle2.txt;;A developer is implementing a custom theme for UI components using TypedArray. The task involves reading custom attributes from XML styles, applying them to various views in a layout, and then handling the TypedArray resource after extracting all the needed values;;;;chimera; com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.Detector.JavaPsiScanner does not support kotlin, but newer versions of Kotlin UAST support
WakeLock;Energy;Yes;;✅;✅;✅;;✅;✅;;;;;;;;✅;Failing to release a wakelock properly can keep the Android device in a high power mode (which reduces battery life). There are several causes of this, such as releasing the wake lock in onDestroy() instead of in onPause(), failing to call release() in all possible code paths after an acquire(), and so on.NOTE: If you are using the lock just to keep the screen on, you should strongly consider using FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON instead. This window flag will be correctly managed by the platform as the user moves between applications and doesn't require a special permission. ;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/Wakelock.md.html;Ensure wake locks are released properly in onPause() instead of onDestroy(), and always include a release() call in all possible code paths. If keeping the screen on is the only goal, use FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON instead, as it is managed automatically by the platform.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;WakeLock1.txt;WakeLock2.txt;;A developer is building a music player service that needs to continue playback when the screen is off. The task involves acquiring a WakeLock in the service that handles audio playback to prevent the CPU from sleeping while music is playing,;;;;lint ;usa lint, suports kt
WakelockTimeout;Energy;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Wakelocks have two acquire methods: one with a timeout, and one without. You should generally always use the one with a timeout. A typical timeout is 10 minutes. If the task takes longer than it is critical that it happens (i.e. can't use JobScheduler) then maybe they should consider a foreground service instead (which is a stronger run guarantee and lets the user know something long/important is happening).;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/WakelockTimeout.md.html;Always use the wake lock acquire method that includes a timeout. A typical timeout is 10 minutes. If longer execution is needed, consider using a foreground service instead, which ensures the task completes while informing the user.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;WakelockTimeout1.txt;WakelockTimeout2.txt;;;;;;;
ViewHolder;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;✅;;;;;;;;✅;"When implementing a view Adapter, you should avoid unconditionally inflating a new layout; if an available item is passed in for reuse, you should try to use that one instead. This helps make for example ListView scrolling much smoother.";https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/ViewHolder.md.html;: In RecyclerView.Adapter and similar adapters, reuse existing views instead of inflating new ones each time. Implement the ViewHolder pattern to improve scrolling performance and reduce unnecessary object creation.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;ViewHolder1.txt;ViewHolder2.txt;;A developer is creating a scrollable feed of social media posts using a RecyclerView. The task involves displaying a list of post objects to view items that display user avatars, post content, and interaction buttons as the user scrolls through the timeline.;;;;pmd;supports kotlin but offers lacks rule for performance 
ObsoleteLayoutParam;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;✅;;;;;;;;✅;The given layout_param is not defined for the given layout, meaning it has no effect. This usually happens when you change the parent layout or move view code around without updating the layout params. This will cause useless attribute processing at runtime, and is misleading for others reading the layout so the parameter should be removed.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/ObsoleteLayoutParam.md.html;Edit the XML file and delete the obsolete parameter that has no effect;*.xml;Warning;ObsoleteLayoutParam1.txt;ObsoleteLayoutParam2.txt;;A developer is developing a UI layout and needs to use a LinearLayout. It has to align the views inside the layout(Buttons, TextViews and Images) with each other and with the parent element.;;;;ecoandroid;no
BLOBClass;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;;Blob Class (BLOB) - OO: A Blob class, also know as God class, is a class with a large number of attributes and/or methods [17]. The Blob class handles a lot of responsibilities compared to other classes. Attributes and methods of this class are related to different concepts and processes, implying a very low cohesion. Blob classes are also often associated with numerous data classes. Blob classes are hard to maintain and increase the difﬁculty to modify the software. In PAPRIKA, classes are identiﬁed as Blob classes whenever the metrics numbers_of_attributes, number_of_methods and lack_of_cohesion_in_methods are very high.;; Refactor the large class by splitting it into multiple smaller, cohesive classes with clear responsibilities. Use Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure each class focuses on a single task. Extract related attributes and methods into separate, more maintainable classes.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;BLOBClass1.txt;BLOBClass2.txt;;A developer is creating the main activity for a messaging application. The task involves handling user authentication, message composition, contact management, media attachment processing, and notification preferences all within a class that serves as the central controller for the application's functionality;;;;;
SwissArmyKnife;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;;A Swiss army knife is a class with numerous interface signatures, resulting in a very complex class interface designed to handle a wide diversity obstractions. This type of class is hard to understand and to maintain because of the resulting complexity. A SAK is detected by Paprika when a class implements a large number of interfaces.;;Reduce the number of interfaces a class implements. If multiple interfaces are needed, consider breaking them into smaller, more specialized interfaces (Interface Segregation Principle). This makes the class easier to understand and maintain.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;SwissArmyKnife1.txt;SwissArmyKnife2.txt;;A developer is building a network utility class for an Android application. The task involves creating a component that implements multiple interfaces to handle different aspects of connectivity, including download management, caching, authentication, encryption, and error handling across the entire application;;;;;
Longmethod;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;;Long methods are implemented with much more lines of code than other methods. They are often very complex, and thus hard to understand and main-tain. These methods can be split into smaller methodstofixtheproblem[21]. Paprika iden- tifies a long method when the number of instructions for one method is very high.;;Break long methods into multiple smaller methods, each performing a specific task. Use method extraction to improve readability and maintainability. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to avoid excessive complexity in a single method.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;Longmethod1.txt;Longmethod2.txt;;A developer needs to implement a data synchronization feature that processes local data, compares it with server data, resolves conflicts, updates the database, and refreshes the UI. Access to this feature should be provided by a single method;;;;;
ComplexClass;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;;A complex class is a class containing complex methods. Again, these classes are hard to understandand maintain and need to be refactored [21]. The class complexity is calculated by summing the internal methods complexities. The complexity of a method can be calculated using McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity [27].;;educe the internal complexity of the class by simplifying complex methods. Use Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe's metric) as a guide to refactor methods into smaller, well-defined methods. Apply design patterns like Strategy or Factory to delegate responsibilities.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;ComplexClass1.txt;ComplexClass2.txt;;A developer is creating a custom camera implementation that handles camera initialization, preview rendering, photo capture, video recording, image processing, and various camera settings. The class should deal with complex decision trees, nested conditions, and multiple execution paths to handle different device capabilities and user interactions.;;;;;
InternalGetterSetter;Runtime;No;✅;✅;✅;✅;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;NA;"On Android, fields should be accessed directly within a class to increase performance. The usage of an internal getter or a setter con- verts into a virtual invoke, which makes the operation three times slower than a direct access . NOTE: As of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), this optimization is performed automatically by Dalvik, so there is no need to change your code; this is only relevant if you are targeting older versions of Android.";;This issue is obsolete for Android versions 2.3 (Gingerbread) and above since the Dalvik runtime optimizes direct field access. If targeting very old versions, access fields directly within the class instead of using getters and setters to improve performance.;*.java, *.kt;Useless;InternalGetterSetter1.txt;InternalGetterSetter2.txt;;A developer is building a data model class for a user profile that contains various attributes like name, email, and preferences. Within the class's internal methods, they access class fields.;;;;;
MemberIgnoringMethod;Runtime;No;✅;✅;✅;;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;;On Android, when a method does not access an object attribute, it is recommended to use a static method. The static method invocations are about 15%–20% faster than a dynamic invocation.;;Non-static methods that do not access any internal properties of the class should be made static in order to increase their efficiency;*.java, *.kt;Warning;MemberIgnoringMethod1.txt;MemberIgnoringMethod2.txt;;A developer is implementing utility functions in a Java Class. One method performs string formatting for display purposes, another validates input patterns, and a third calculates statistical methods over the data provided as input ;;;;;
NoLowMemoryResolver;Memory;Yes;;✅;✅;;;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;✅;When the Android system is running low on memory, the system calls the method onLowMemory() of running activities, which are supposed to trim their memory usage. If this method is not implemented by the activity, the Android system kills the process in order to free memory, and can cause an abnormal termination of programs ;;Implement the onLowMemory() and onTrimMemory(int level) methods in Activity and Application classes to handle low-memory situations. Free unnecessary resources, clear caches, and optimize memory usage to prevent unexpected app termination.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;NoLowMemoryResolver1.txt;NoLowMemoryResolver2.txt;; developer is creating an image gallery application that loads and caches multiple high-resolution images. The application implements Activity and Fragment lifecycle methods to load and show the gallery and individual photos;;;;;
LeakingInnerClass;Memory;No;;✅;✅;✅;;;;✅;✅;;✅;;;;;In Java, non-static inner and anonymous classes are holding a reference to the outer class, whereas static inner classes are not. This could provoke a memory leak in Android systems;;Convert non-static inner classes to static inner classes or use WeakReference to avoid memory leaks. If an inner class requires access to the outer class, use a WeakReference<OuterClass> instead of a direct reference.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;LeakingInnerClass1.txt;LeakingInnerClass2.txt;;A developer is implementing a long-running background task that processes data and needs to update the UI when complete. Inside an Activity, they need to handle the background work.;;;;;
UnsuitedLRUCacheSize;Memory;Yes;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;;;;in Android, a cache can be used to store frequently used objects with the Least Recently Used (LRU) API. The code smell occurs when the LRU is initialized without checking the available memory via the getMemoryClass() method. The available memory may vary considerably according to the device so it is necessary to adapt the cache size to the available memory;;When initializing an LRUCache, set its size dynamically based on available memory using ActivityManager.getMemoryClass(). This ensures the cache size adapts to different device specifications, preventing excessive memory usage.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;UnsuitedLRUCacheSize1.txt;UnsuitedLRUCacheSize2.txt;;A developer is building a news reader application that caches article images to improve scrolling performance, which suggest the need to use an LRU cache.;;;;;
HashmapUsage;Memory;Yes;✅;✅;✅;✅;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;✅;the usage of HashMap is inadvisable when managing small sets in Android. Using HashMaps entails the auto-boxing process where primitive types are converted into generic objects. The issue is that generic objects are much larger than primitive types, 16 and 4 bytes, respectively. Therefore, the framework recommends using the SparseArray data structure that is more memory-eﬃcient;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/UseSparseArrays.md.html;Replace HashMap<Integer, Object> with SparseArray<T>, SparseIntArray, or SparseBooleanArray when working with primitive integer keys. This avoids auto-boxing and significantly reduces memory consumption.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;HashmapUsage1.txt;HashmapUsage2.txt;;A developer is implementing a feature to store and retrieve configuration settings with integer keys on memory;;;;;
Overdraw;Energy;yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;;"If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called “overdraw”. NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden. If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background. Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.";;Remove unnecessary background layers in XML or Java code. If setting a custom background on a root view, use a theme with a transparent background instead of layering multiple backgrounds. Pre-mix translucent backgrounds with images for better performance.;*.xml;Warning;Overdraw1.txt;Overdraw2.txt;; A developer is designing a custom list item layout for a RecyclerView. The layout includes a root FrameLayout, a CardView and an inner LinearLayout with background color. ;;;;;
UIOverdraw;Energy;Yes;;;✅;✅;;;;✅;✅;;;;;;✅;a UI Overdraw is a situation where a pixel of the screen is drawn many times in the same frame. This happens when the UI design consists of unneeded overlapping layers, e.g., hidden backgrounds. To avoid such situations, the canvas.quickreject() API should be used to define the view boundaries that are drawable;;"Optimize layout design by removing overlapping UI layers. Use canvas.quickReject() to define drawable boundaries and prevent unnecessary rendering. Enable ""Show GPU Overdraw"" in Developer Options to detect excessive overdraw.";*.java, *.kt;Warning;UIOverdraw1.txt;UIOverdraw2.txt;;A developer is creating a custom view that draws a complex visualization with multiple layers of graphics. The implementation should draw all elements for every frame.;;;;;
InvalidatewithoutRect;Runtime;Yes;;;;;;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;;refers to a code smell that arises when rect to be redrawn is not specified while invalidating the view;; When calling invalidate(), specify a bounding rectangle (invalidate(Rect) or invalidate(left, top, right, bottom)) to redraw only the affected area instead of the entire view, improving performance.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;InvalidatewithoutRect1.txt;InvalidatewithoutRect2.txt;;A developer is implementing a custom view that displays real-time data visualization. When new data arrives, the view needs to be redrawn to reflect changes and evaluate when only a small section has changed.;;;;;
UnsupportedHardwareAcceleration;Runtime;Yes;;;;;;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;;On Android, most of the drawing operations are executed in the GPU. Rare drawing operations that are executed in the CPU, e.g., drawPath method in android.graphics.Canvas, should be avoided to reduce CPU load;;Avoid CPU-bound drawing operations like Canvas.drawPath() in performance-critical areas.

HeavyAsyncTask;Runtime;Yes;;;;;;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;;refers to a code smell that arises when heavy operations are carried out inside an Async Task. Heavy operation is considered to be any operation that has computational complexity of greater than 10 (McConnel S. Code Complete).;;Offload heavy computations (e.g., complex loops, large database operations) from AsyncTask.doInBackground() to background worker threads using Executors, Coroutines, or WorkManager.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;HeavyAsyncTask1.txt;HeavyAsyncTask2.txt;;A developer is implementing an image processing feature that applies complex filters to photos and perform this task on the background;;;;;
HeavyServiceStart;Energy;Yes;;;;;;;;✅;✅;✅;;;;;;refers to a code smell that arises when heavy operations are carried out inside a Service;;void running long or computationally expensive tasks inside Service.

LeakingThread;Memory;No;;✅;✅;✅?;;;;;;✅;;;;;✅;In Android programming a thread is a garbage collector (GC) root. The GC does not collect the root bjects and, therefore, if a thread is not adequately stopped it can remain in memory for all the execution of the application, causing an abuse of the memory of the app. If an Activity starts a thread and does not stop it this is considered a design ﬂaw [18]. ADOCTOR detects this smell if a method of an Activity class starts a thread without stopping it through the stop method.;;Ensure that threads started within an Activity are properly stopped when the activity is destroyed.

DevModeObsolete;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;In the past, our documentation recommended creating a dev product flavor with has a minSdkVersion of 21, in order to enable multidexing to speed up builds significantly during development. That workaround is no longer necessary, and it has some serious downsides, such as breaking API access checking (since the true minSdkVersion is no longer known). In recent versions of the IDE and the Gradle plugin, the IDE automatically passes the API level of the connected device used for deployment, and if that device is at least API 21, then multidexing is automatically turned on, meaning that you get the same speed benefits as the dev product flavor but without the downsides.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/DevModeObsolete.md.html;The workaround of creating a dev product flavor with minSdkVersion 21 to enable multidexing is no longer necessary. Multidexing is now handled automatically if the connected device runs API 21 or higher. Simply ensure you're using the appropriate Gradle configuration without the dev flavor workaround.;*.gradle;Warning;DevModeObsolete1.txt;DevModeObsolete2.txt;;"A developer is trying to speed up development builds by creating a separate ""dev"" product flavor";;;;;
LifecycleAnnotationProcessorWithJava8;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;"For faster incremental build, switch to the Lifecycle Java 8 API with these steps: First replace annotationProcessor ""androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-compiler:*version*"" kapt ""androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-compiler:*version*"" with implementation ""androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-common-java8:*version*"" Then remove any OnLifecycleEvent annotations from Observer classes and make them implement the DefaultLifecycleObserver interface.";https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/LifecycleAnnotationProcessorWithJava8.md.html;"For faster incremental builds, switch to the Lifecycle Java 8 API by replacing annotationProcessor ""androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-compiler"" with implementation ""androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-common-java8"".

AnnotationProcessorOnCompilePath;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;This dependency is identified as an annotation processor. Consider adding it to the processor path using annotationProcessor instead of including it to the compile path.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/AnnotationProcessorOnCompilePath.md.html; If an annotation processor is included in the compile classpath, move it to the annotationProcessor path instead to optimize the build process.;*.gradle;Warning;AnnotationProcessorOnCompilePath1.txt;AnnotationProcessorOnCompilePath2.txt;;A developer is adding an annotation processor library (like Dagger or Butterknife) to their project's dependencies;;;;;
LogConditional;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;The BuildConfig class provides a constant, DEBUG, which indicates whether the code is being built in release mode or in debug mode. In release mode, you typically want to strip out all the logging calls. Since the compiler will automatically remove all code which is inside a if (false) check, surrounding your logging calls with a check for BuildConfig.DEBUG is a good idea. If you really intend for the logging to be present in release mode, you can suppress this warning with a @SuppressLint annotation for the intentional logging calls.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/LogConditional.md.html;Wrap log statements in a check for BuildConfig.DEBUG to ensure logging is only active in debug builds and automatically removed from release builds.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;LogConditional1.txt;LogConditional2.txt;;A developer is implementing logging throughout their application for debugging purposes only;;;;;
WearableBindListener;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;BIND_LISTENER receives all Android Wear events whether the application needs them or not. This can be inefficient and cause applications to wake up unnecessarily. With Google Play Services 8.2.0 or later it is recommended to use a more efficient combination of manifest listeners and api-based live listeners filtered by action, path and/or path prefix.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/WearableBindListener.md.html;For Android Wear apps, avoid using the BIND_LISTENER unless necessary, as it can cause inefficiency by waking the app unnecessarily. Use manifest listeners and API-based live listeners instead.;*.xml;Fatal;WearableBindListener1.txt;WearableBindListener2.txt;;A developer is creating a Wear OS application to receive Android Wear events;;;;;
UsableSpace;Memory;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;When you need to allocate disk space for large files, consider using the new allocateBytes(FileDescriptor, long) API, which will automatically clear cached files belonging to other apps (as needed) to meet your request. When deciding if the device has enough disk space to hold your new data, call getAllocatableBytes(UUID) instead of using getUsableSpace(), since the former will consider any cached data that the system is willing to clear on your behalf.Note that these methods require API level 26. If your app is running on older devices, you will probably need to use both APIs, conditionally switching on Build.VERSION.SDK_INT. Lint only looks in the same compilation unit to see if you are already using both APIs, so if it warns even though you are already using the new API, consider moving the calls to the same file or suppressing the warning.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/UsableSpace.md.html;When allocating disk space for large files, use allocateBytes(FileDescriptor, long) (API level 26+) to clear other app’s cached files if needed.

ViewTag;Memory;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Prior to Android 4.0, the implementation of View.setTag(int, Object) would store the objects in a static map, where the values were strongly referenced. This means that if the object contains any references pointing back to the context, the context (which points to pretty much everything else) will leak. If you pass a view, the view provides a reference to the context that created it. Similarly, view holders typically contain a view, and cursors are sometimes also associated with views.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/ViewTag.md.html;Avoid using View.setTag(int, Object) before Android 4.0 as it could cause memory leaks due to static map references. This can result in the context being leaked if the tag holds a reference back to the context.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;ViewTag1.txt;ViewTag2.txt;;A developer is implementing a ListView with complex items and needs to store references to views for the ViewHolder pattern.;;;;;
TooManyViews;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Using too many views in a single layout is bad for performance.

UseCompoundDrawables;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;A LinearLayout which contains an ImageView and a TextView can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable (a single TextView, using the drawableTop, drawableLeft, drawableRight and/or drawableBottom attributes to draw one or more images adjacent to the text).;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/UseCompoundDrawables.md.html;Combine ImageView and TextView using drawableLeft, drawableTop, drawableRight, or drawableBottom attributes to improve performance instead of adding multiple views.;*.xml;Warning;UseCompoundDrawables1.txt;UseCompoundDrawables2.txt;;A developer is creating list items that display an icon next to text. ;;;;;
UseOfBundledGooglePlayServices;Memory;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Google Play services SDK's can be selectively included, which enables a smaller APK size. Consider declaring dependencies on individual Google Play services SDK's. If you are using Firebase API's(https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), Android Studio's Tools → Firebase assistant window can automatically add just the dependencies needed for each feature.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/UseOfBundledGooglePlayServices.md.html;Declare dependencies of individual Google Play services SDK's;*.gradle;Warning;UseOfBundledGooglePlayServices1.txt;UseOfBundledGooglePlayServices2.txt;;A developer has to add Google Play Services to their app ;;;;;
StringFormatTrivial;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Every call to String.format creates a new Formatter instance, which will decrease the performance of your app. String.format should only be used when necessary—if the formatted string contains only trivial conversions (e.g. b, s, c) and there are no translation concerns, it will be more efficient to replace them and concatenate with +.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/StringFormatTrivial.md.html;void using String.format for trivial string formatting as it creates a new Formatter instance, which reduces performance.

ExpensiveAssertion;Runtime;Yes;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;In Kotlin, assertions are not handled the same way as from the Java programming language. In particular, they're just implemented as a library call, and inside the library call the error is only thrown if assertions are enabled.This means that the arguments to the assert call will always be evaluated. If you're doing any computation in the expression being asserted, that computation will unconditionally be performed whether or not assertions are turned on. This typically turns into wasted work in release builds. This check looks for cases where the assertion condition is nontrivial, e.g. it is performing method calls or doing more work than simple comparisons on local variables or fields.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/ExpensiveAssertion.md.html;n Kotlin, assertions are implemented as library calls, meaning computations in the assert statement are always evaluated regardless of whether assertions are enabled.

AutoboxingStateCreation;Runtime;No;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Calling mutableStateOf<t>() when T is either backed by a primitive type on the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized primitive state implementation for Int, Long, Float, and Double when the state does not need to track null values and does not override the default SnapshotMutationPolicy. See mutableIntStateOf(), mutableLongStateOf(), mutableFloatStateOf(), and mutableDoubleStateOf() for more information.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/AutoboxingStateCreation.md.html;Use mutableIntStateOf(), mutableLongStateOf(), etc. instead of mutableStateOf() for primitives.;*.java, *.kt;Warning;AutoboxingStateCreation1.txt;AutoboxingStateCreation2.txt;;A developer is implementing a Jetpack Compose UI that needs to track an integer counter. ;;;;;
AutoboxingStateValueProperty;Runtime;No;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;Avoid using the generic value property when using a specialized State type. Reading or writing to the state's generic value property will result in an unnecessary autoboxing operation.

SyntheticAccessor;Runtime;No;;;;✅;;;;;;;;;;;✅;A private inner class which is accessed from the outer class will force the compiler to insert a synthetic accessor. this means that you are causing extra overhead. This is not important in small projects, but is important for large apps running up against the 64K method handle limit, and especially for libraries where you want to make sure your library is as small as possible for the cases where your library is used in an app running up against the 64K limit.;https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/checks/SyntheticAccessor.md.html;Change the modifier of the class, method or field to protected or public;*.java, *.kt;Warning;SyntheticAccessor1.txt;SyntheticAccessor2.txt;;A developer is creating a inner class that needs to access fields or methods from the outer class;;;;;

It is more efficient to use the integer implementations of String.lastIndexOf(). f. e. call myString.lastIndexOf('.') instead of myString.lastIndexOf(""."")";;;;;InefficientLastIndexOf1.txt;InefficientLastIndexOf2.txt;;A developer needs to get a file extension from a filename (String) using lastIndexOf;;;;;
UnnecessaryMath;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;;This method uses a static method from java.lang.Math on a constant value. This method's result in this case, can be determined statically, and is faster and sometimes more accurate to just use the constant;https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bugDescriptions.html#um-method-calls-static-math-class-method-on-a-constant-value-um-unnecessary-math;Use  constant values instead;;;UnnecessaryMath1.txt;UnnecessaryMath2.txt;;A developer needs to perform math calculations for a reduced set of possible values;;;;;
BloatedSynchronizedBlock;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;This method implements a synchronized block, but the code found at the beginning of this block only accesses local variables, and not member variables or this. For better performance, move the code that accesses local variables only above the synchronized block, and leave the synchronized block only for field accesses, or access to this.;;Refactor synchronized block;;;BloatedSynchronizedBlock1.txt;BloatedSynchronizedBlock2.txt;;A developer uses a synchronized block while managing a lot of variables and operations ;;;;;
DubiousListCollection;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;This class defines a field based on java.util.List, but uses it to some extent like a Set. Since lookup type operations are performed using a linear search for Lists, the performance for large Lists will be poor. If the list is known to only contain a small number of items (3, 4, etc), then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, consider changing this field's implementation to a set-based one. If order of iteration is important to maintain insert order, perhaps consider a LinkedHashSet.;;;;;DubiousListCollection1.txt;DubiousListCollection2.txt;;A developer needs to To check for the existence of a user ID in a large list of moderators;;;;;
DubiousSetofCollections;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a method creates a set that contains other collections, or a Map whose keySet is another collection. As collections tend to calculate hashCode, equals, and compareTo by iterating the contents of the collection, this can perform poorly. In addition, when a set is used, you typically are using it to do 'contains', or 'find' type functionality, which seems dubious when done on a collection. Finally, as a collection is often modified, problems will occur if the collection is contained in a set, because the hashCode, equals or compareTo values will change while the collection is in the set. If you wish to maintain a collection of collections, it is probably better to use a List as the outer collection.;;;;;DubiousSetofCollections1.txt;DubiousSetofCollections2.txt;;A developer needs to use a HashSet  to store unique permission sets for each user type;;;;;
ContainsOnCollectedStream;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a method builds a collection using lambda expressions with a collect terminal operation. It then immediately calls the contains() method on it, to see if an item is present. This is sub optimal as the lambda still needs to build the entire collection, iterating the entire source list. It is better to use anyMatch() to short circuit the building of the collection.;;;;;ContainsOnCollectedStream1.txt;ContainsOnCollectedStream2.txt;;A developer checks if a product is in stock by streaming;;;;;
AvoidSizeOnCollectedStream;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a  methods builds a collection using lambda expressions with a collect terminal operation. It then immediately calls the size() method on it, to get a count of items. This is sub optimal as the lambda still needs to build the entire collection, iterating the entire source list. It is better to use count() predicate to short circuit the building of the collection. If you were using a Set, then also add the distinct() predicate.;;;;;AvoidSizeOnCollectedStream1.txt;AvoidSizeOnCollectedStream2.txt;;To count the number of active users, a developer streams, filters them and then needs to calcule the size of the filtered set;;;;;
UseFindFirst;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;Use of streams data into a List just to call get(0) to get the first item. You can just use findFirst() to short circuit the processing of the stream.;;;;;UseFindFirst1.txt;UseFindFirst2.txt;;A developer uses streams to get the first premium user;;;;;
ExecutorNotShuttingDown;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;Most ExecutorService objects must be explicitly shut down, otherwise their internal threads can prevent the JVM from ever shutting down, even when everything else has stopped.;;;;;ExecutorNotShuttingDown1.txt;ExecutorNotShuttingDown2.txt;; developer creates a temporary ExecutorService in a method to run a task;;;;;
DoubleBufferCopy;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a mehtod copies data from input to output using streams or reader/writers using a well known copy method, from java.nio, commons-io, springframework, guava or poi. These methods are efficient in that they copy these files using buffers. However, this method is also buffering the streams, causing a double buffering to occur. So data first goes to one buffer, then is copied to another buffer, before making it to the destination (or vice-versa). This just causes the copy operation to be inefficient both from a time perspective and a memory allocation one. When using these copy methods, do not pass buffered streams/readers/writers.;;;;;DoubleBufferCopy1.txt;DoubleBufferCopy2.txt;;A developer is neeeds buffering while reading files with FileInputStream ;;;;;
ListIndexIterating;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;Using an Iterator can perform better for certain List implementations (like LinkedList).;;;;;ListIndexIterating1.txt;ListIndexIterating2.txt;;A developer needs to  iterate a LinkedList;;;;;
LogToStringParameter;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a method uses parameterized logging to avoid the cost of string concatenation in the case that the log level does not meet the needed level. However, one or more of the parameters passed to the logging method uses .toString() to present a String representation for the parameter. This is unneeded as the logger will do this for you, and because it is explicitly done, will always be called even if the log statement is not actually written. Also, by dropping the '.toString()' you may avoid unnecessary NPEs. Just pass the variable as a parameter instead.;;;;;LogToStringParameter1.txt;LogToStringParameter2.txt;;A developer logs a user object with a custom message;;;;;
LogAppendedStringInFormat;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a  method uses an SLF4J or Log4j2 logger to log a string, where the first (format) string is created using concatenation. You should use {} markers to inject dynamic content into the string, so that String building is delayed until the actual log string is needed. If the log level is high enough that this log statement isn't used, then the appends will never be executed.;;;;;LogAppendedStringInFormat1.txt;LogAppendedStringInFormat2.txt;;A developer logs a user object with a custom message and needs to concatenate strings for that;;;;;
LocalSynchronizedCollection;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A  method creates a synchronized collection and stores the reference to it in a local variable. As local variables are by definition thread-safe, it seems questionable that this collection needs to be synchronized.;;;;;LocalSynchronizedCollection1.txt;LocalSynchronizedCollection2.txt;;A developer needs to manipulate a local ArrayList In a single-threaded method;;;;;
UseSingletonList;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A  method builds a list using Arrays.asList(foo), passing in a single element. Arrays.asList needs to first create an array from this one element, and then build a List that wraps this array. It is simpler to use Collections.singletonList(foo), which does not create the array, and produces a far simpler instance of List. Since both of these arrays are immutable (from the List's point of view) they are equivalent from a usage standpoint. There is one difference between Array.asList and Collections.singletonList that you should be mindful of. The rarely used set(index, value) method is allowed to be used with a List created by Array.asList, but not with Collections.singletonList. So if you do use the set(index, value) method continue using Arrays.asList.;;;;;UseSingletonList1.txt;UseSingletonList2.txt;;A developer needs to return a list containing a single literal string;;;;;
RunFinalization;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"Manually triggering finalization can result in serious performance problems and may be masking resource cleanup bugs. Only the garbage collector, not application code, should be concerned with finalization.
";;;;;RunFinalization1.txt;RunFinalization2.txt;;Concerned about memory, a developer whants to improve memory consumption after running an heavy task;;;;;
CallingSizeOnSubContainer;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method calls size on the keySet(), entrySet() or values() collections of a Map. These sub collections will have the same size as the base Map and so it is just simpler to call size on that Map. Calling size() on one of these sub collections will causes unnecessary allocations to occur.;;;;;CallingSizeOnSubContainer1.txt;CallingSizeOnSubContainer2.txt;;A developer checks if a map is empty when iterating a map through keySet();;;;;
ContainsKeyBeforeGet;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method checks for the presence of a key in a map using containsKey(), before attempting to fetch the value of the key using get(). This equates to doing two map lookups in a row. It is much simpler to just fetch the value with get, and checking for non null instead.;;;;;ContainsKeyBeforeGet1.txt;ContainsKeyBeforeGet2.txt;;A developer needs to get a value from a Map if exists;;;;;
GetBeforeRemove;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method fetches the value of an entry in a map using get(K k), and then follows it up with a remove(K k). Since a remove() also returns the value, there is no point for doing the get, and just causes two map lookups to occur when it can be done with just one.;;;;;GetBeforeRemove1.txt;GetBeforeRemove2.txt;;A developer needs to remove a value from a Map if exists and return it ;;;;;
NeedlessInstanceRetrieval;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method calls a method to load a reference to an object, and then only uses it to load a static member of that instance's class. It is simpler and more performant to just load the static field from the class itself.;;;;;NeedlessInstanceRetrieval1.txt;NeedlessInstanceRetrieval2.txt;;A developer needs to get a static constant ;;;;;
NeedlessMemberCollectionSynchronization;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"A class defines a private collection member as synchronized. It appears, however, that this collection is only modified in a static initializer, or constructor. As these two areas are guaranteed to be thread safe, defining this collection as synchronized is unnecessary and a potential performance bottleneck.
";;;;;NeedlessMemberCollectionSynchronization1.txt;NeedlessMemberCollectionSynchronization2.txt;;A developer declares a synchronizedSet and populates it in the constructor;;;;;
OptionalPrimitiveVariantPreferred;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"A method creates an Optional object to hold an int, double or long. In these cases it is more natural to use the Optional variants OptionalInt, OptionalDouble and OptionalLong.
";;;;;OptionalPrimitiveVariantPreferred1.txt;OptionalPrimitiveVariantPreferred2.txt;;A developer wants to use Optional*<> primitives to return user's age;;;;;
OptionalIssuesUsesImmediateExecution;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method uses the Optional.orElse() method passing in some code that will execute immediately, whether or not the else case of the Optional is needed. This may cause incorrect side effects to happen, or at the minimum, code to execute for no reason. It would be better to use Optional.orElseGet();;;;;OptionalIssuesUsesImmediateExecution1.txt;OptionalIssuesUsesImmediateExecution2.txt;;A developer provides a default value to an optional;;;;;
InstanceBasedThreadLocal;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;When a ThreadLocal field is defined as being instance based (not static). As all ThreadLocal variables describe permanent reachability roots so far as the garbage collector is concerned, these variables will never be reclaimed (so long as the Thread lives). Since this ThreadLocal is instanced, you potentially will be creating many non-reclaimable variables, even after the owning instance has been reclaimed. It is almost a certainty that you want to use static based ThreadLocal variables.;;;;;InstanceBasedThreadLocal1.txt;InstanceBasedThreadLocal2.txt;;A developer needs to declare a ThreadLocal field in a request handler class;;;;;
PossibleMemoryBloat;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A class defines static fields that are Collections, StringBuffers, or StringBuilders that do not appear to have any way to clear or reduce their size. That is, a collection is defined and has method calls like {add(), append(), offer(), put(), ...} with no method calls to removal methods like {clear(), delete(), pop(), remove(), ...} This means that the collection in question can only ever increase in size, which is a potential cause of memory bloat.;;;;;PossibleMemoryBloat1.txt;PossibleMemoryBloat2.txt;;A developer creates a static final Map as an in-memory cache;;;;;
PreSizeCollections;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;This method allocates a collection using the default constructor even though it is known a priori (or at least can be reasonably guessed) how many items are going to be placed in the collection, and thus needlessly causes intermediate reallocations of the collection. You can use the constructor that takes an initial size and that will be much better, but due to the loadFactor of Maps and Sets, even this will not be a correct estimate.;;;;;PreSizeCollections1.txt;PreSizeCollections2.txt;;A developer needs to copy a 10,000-element list into a new ArrayList;;;;;
SubOptimalCollectionSizing;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"This method allocates a collection using the a constructor that takes a size parameter. However, because Maps and Sets have a loading factor, passing in the exact size you want is an incorrect way to presize the collection, and may still cause reallocations. Since you are using Guava, it is better to use  Maps.newHashMapWithExpectedSize(c.size());  or Sets.newHashSetWithExpectedsize(c.size());  as this method calculates the correct size taking into account the loading factor. Alternatively, if you know that the collection will not grow beyond the initial size, you can specify a load factor of 1.0F in the constructor.";;;;;SubOptimalCollectionSizing1.txt;SubOptimalCollectionSizing2.txt;;A developer initializes a HashSet that will hold exactly 100 items;;;;;
StaticArrayCreatedInMethod;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A  method creates an array initialized by constants. Each time this method is called this array will be recreated. It would be more performant to define the array as a static field of the class instead.;;;;;StaticArrayCreatedInMethod1.txt;StaticArrayCreatedInMethod2.txt;;A develper needs a method that returns a constant array of default values ;;;;;
SubOptimalExpressionOrder;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A method builds a conditional expression, for example, in an if or while statement, where the expressions contain both simple local variable comparisons and comparisons on method calls. The expression orders these so that the method calls come before the simple local variable comparisons. This causes method calls to be executed in conditions when they do not need to be, and thus potentially causes a lot of code to be executed for nothing. By ordering the expressions so that the simple conditions containing local variable conditions are first, you eliminate this waste. This assumes that the method calls do not have side effects. If the methods do have side effects, it is probably a better idea to pull these calls out of the condition and execute them first, assigning a value to a local variable. In this way you give a hint that the call may have side effects.;;;;;SubOptimalExpressionOrder1.txt;SubOptimalExpressionOrder2.txt;;A developer needs complex conditional expressions in a if;;;;;
SQLInLoop;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;A  method executes SQL queries inside of a loop. This pattern is often inefficient as the number of queries may mushroom in fencepost cases. It is probably more performant to loop over the input and collect the key data needed for the query for all items, and issue one query using an in clause, or similar construct, and then loop over this result set, and fetch all the data at once.;;;;;SQLInLoop1.txt;SQLInLoop2.txt;;A developer needs to fetch data for 100 users from a database;;;;;
ContainsBeforeAdd;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"This method checks to see if an element is not in a set before adding it. This is unnecessary as you can just add the item, and if the item exists, it won't add it, otherwise it will.
";;;;;ContainsBeforeAdd1.txt;ContainsBeforeAdd2.txt;;A developer needs to add a value to a set that might exist already;;;;;
ContainsBeforeRemove;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"This method checks to see if an element is in a set before removing it. This is unnecessary as you can just remove the item, and if the item exists, it will return true.
";;;;;ContainsBeforeRemove1.txt;ContainsBeforeRemove2.txt;;A developer needs to remove a value from a set that might not exist yet;;;;;
TailRecursion;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"This method recursively calls itself as the last statement of the method (Tail Recursion). This method can be easily refactored into a simple loop, which will make it more performant, and reduce the stack size requirements.
";;;;;TailRecursion1.txt;TailRecursion2.txt;;A developer implements a fibonnacci algorithm ;;;;;
UseAddAll;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;"This method uses a simple for loop to copy the contents of a set, list, map key/value, array or other collection to another collection. It is simpler and more straightforward to just call the addAll method of the destination collection passing in the source collection. In the case that the source is an array, you can use the Arrays.asList method to wrap the array into a collection.
";;;;;UseAddAll1.txt;UseAddAll2.txt;;A developer needs to copy one list into another ;;;;;
UseEnumCollections;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;This class uses an ordinary set or map collection and uses an enum class as the key type. It is more performant to use the JDK 1.5 EnumSet or EnumMap classes.;;;;;UseEnumCollections1.txt;UseEnumCollections2.txt;;A developer needs a Map to store Enum values as key;;;;;
UnjitableMethod;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;;;;This method is longer than 8000 bytes. By default the JIT will not attempt to compile this method no matter how hot it is, and so this method will always be interpreted. If performance is important, you should consider breaking this method up into smaller chunks. (And it's probably a good idea for readability too!);;;;;UnjitableMethod1.txt;UnjitableMethod2.txt;;A developer needs to write a very extensive method;;;;;
ArrayPrimitive;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;✅;Using `Array<Primitive>` leads to implicit boxing and performance hit. Prefer using Kotlin specialized Array Instances.  Kotlin has specialized arrays to represent primitive types without boxing overhead, such as `IntArray`, `ByteArray` and so on.;https://github.com/detekt/detekt/blob/main/detekt-rules-performance/src/main/kotlin/dev/detekt/rules/performance/ArrayPrimitive.kt;Replace generic Arrays with specialized arrays;;;ArrayPrimitive1.txt;ArrayPrimitive2.txt;; A developer needs an Array to store millions of integers;;;;;
CouldBeSequence;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;✅;Long chains of collection operations will have a performance penalty due to a new list being created for each call.

ForEachOnRange;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;✅;Using the forEach method on ranges has a heavy performance cost. Prefer using simple for loops.  Benchmarks have shown that using forEach on a range can have a huge performance cost in comparison to  simple for loops. Hence, in most contexts, a simple for loop should be used instead.;https://github.com/detekt/detekt/blob/main/detekt-rules-performance/src/main/kotlin/dev/detekt/rules/performance/ForEachOnRange.kt;To solve this code smell, the forEach usage over an range should be replaced by a for loop;;;ForEachOnRange1.txt;ForEachOnRange2.txt;;A developer needs to perform a loop form 1 to 1 million;;;;;
SpreadOperator;Memory;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;✅;In most cases using a spread operator causes a full copy of the array to be created before calling a method.  This has a very high performance penalty.  The Kotlin compiler since v1.1.60 has an optimization that skips the array copy when an array constructor function is used to create the arguments that are passed to the vararg parameter. This case will not be flagged by the rule since it doesn't suffer the performance penalty of an array copy.;;Refactor in order to the array copy be skipped for the usage of the spread operator;;;SpreadOperator1.txt;SpreadOperator2.txt;;a developer needs to write a function to process a large array and already has a function to do that in the same class that receives an unlimited number of arguments;;;;;
UnnecessaryPartOfBinaryExpression;Runtime;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;✅;✅;when a method uses unnecessary binary expressions, including those in `if` and `when` conditions, as well as all predicates.;https://github.com/detekt/detekt/blob/main/detekt-rules-performance/src/main/kotlin/dev/detekt/rules/performance/UnnecessaryPartOfBinaryExpression.kt;Remove unncessary part of binary expression;;;UnnecessaryPartOfBinaryExpression1.txt;UnnecessaryPartOfBinaryExpression2.txt;;A developer writes if with fixed constatn values;;;;;
